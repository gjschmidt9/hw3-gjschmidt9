# CS272-S25 HW3 - Accessibility

For this HW, you will be improving the accessibility of my personal website! In particular, you will fix any of the following accessibility issues...

 - Meta information provided in the `head`
 - Missing heading levels
 - Images missing alternative text
 - Text with low contrast
 - Unlabelled inputs
 - Distracting animations
 - Inconsistent navigation bars
 - Poor responsiveness

... as well as anything else you see fit! As you make your changes, please update the list within the "My Updates" section of this `README.md`.

In order to get full credit, you will need to make at least 7 different types changes and list them in this `README.md` file below. For example, adding `alt` text to each image counts as a single change. Changing all `px` to `rem` is another type of change!

If you have questions, please contact your instructor early!

**Be sure to edit the list below with your changes!**
