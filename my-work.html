            <h5>Smart Burrow Upgrade: Climate Control</h5>
            <p>
              I installed a suite of smart devices tailored to the unique needs
              of subterranean living.
            </p>
            <p>
              I outfitted my chambers with a smart thermostat that adjusted
              airflow based on soil temperature and humidity, ensuring the
              burrow stayed snug in winter and cool in summer. Next came smart
              lighting: tiny bioluminescent fixtures connected to motion sensors
              that illuminates tunnels as I pass, saving energy and guiding
              late-night wanderings.

            <h5>Smart Burrow Upgrade: Security</h5>
            <p>
              I installed a suite of smart devices tailored to the unique needs
              of subterranean living.
            </p>
            <p>
              A network of discreet cameras at the burrow entrances keeps an eye
              out for unwelcome visitors, from nosy foxes to mischievous
              hedgehogs. The system is paired with smart locks carved from
              sturdy oak, which can be opened with my pawprint.
